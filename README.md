Mod Information
=======

Implements several changes regarding the mechanics of both the Pale Garden and Creaking:

Hostile Mobs excluding the Creaking can no longer spawn in Pale Gardens

The Pale Garden now has a dense white fog that encompasses the players vision whenever entering the biome

Creakings now emit an effect in a similar manner to how the Warden emits the Darkness Effect. The effect is known
as Haziness, and if the player is in the Pale Garden while the effect is active, the fogs density drastically increases
